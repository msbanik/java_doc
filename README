I spent most of my time on bash terminal and looked for some command line javadoc tools, something like ruby or python interpreter's built in help system. I didn't found something good, so I build one for myself :). It is a great way to exploring the java API or any API generated using javadoc tools after some processing. You can search for packages, class, method, java docs, etc. It's support regular expression. You can apply nesting search like package:class:method means find some method on a class under this package. It's also highlight the search result and javadoc. Some example here.

>> Math.sqrt

Help on sqrt

public static double sqrt(double a)

 Returns the correctly rounded positive square root of a double value.
 Special cases:

         * If the argument is NaN or less than zero, then the result is NaN.
         * If the argument is positive infinity, then the result is positive infinity.
         * If the argument is positive zero or negative zero, then the result is the same as the argument. Otherwise, the result is the double value closest to the true mathematical square root of the argument value.

 Parameters:

     a - a value.
 Returns:

     the positive square root of a. If the argument is NaN or less than zero, the result is NaN.
